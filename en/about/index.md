Growing up, every Sunday, you could catch me on the couch of my parent's living room looking at football. It was a weekly thing during football season, and it eventually got to a point where my family would have me place bets for who would be the weekly winners. Sometimes I was successful, but other times I wasn't. It wasn't until my undergrad years where I realized what I was doing at a young age was sports data analytics in my head and it was helping me to place bets. I also never knew I could work in sports unless you were an athlete, but once I learned about the sports industry, I realized this was the field for me (no pun intended). 

Now as a major sports fan and frequent sporting event attendee, I'm interested in working for NFL, NBA, and MLB organizations. With my wide technical skillset, I am wanting to use data analytics to improve fan experience and marketing for sports teams as well as using data to help improve team and player performance.
